However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.\n","authors":["Yuxiang Huang","Binhang Yuan","Xu Han","Chaojun Xiao","Zhiyuan Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01805v1.pdf","comment":"Preprints"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01795v1","updated":"2024-10-02T17:53:08Z","published":"2024-10-02T17:53:08Z","title":"Knowledge-Driven Feature Selection and Engineering for Genotype Data\n  with Large Language Models","summary":"  Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small,\ninterpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task.\nConventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high\ndimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction\ndifficult.

Recently, this\nability has been applied to the paradigm of tool learning. Tool learning\ninvolves providing examples of tool usage and their corresponding functions,\nallowing LLMs to formulate plans and demonstrate the process of invoking and\nexecuting each tool. LLMs can address tasks that they cannot complete\nindependently, thereby enhancing their potential across different tasks.\nHowever, this approach faces two key challenges. First, redundant error\ncorrection leads to unstable planning and long execution time. Additionally,\ndesigning a correct plan among multiple tools is also a challenge in tool\nlearning. To address these issues, we propose Tool-Planner, a task-processing\nframework based on toolkits. Tool-Planner groups tools based on the API\nfunctions with the same function into a toolkit and allows LLMs to implement\nplanning across the various toolkits. When a tool error occurs, the language\nmodel can reselect and adjust tools based on the toolkit. Experiments show that\nour approach demonstrates a high pass and win rate across different datasets\nand optimizes the planning scheme for tool learning in models such as GPT-4 and\nClaude 3, showcasing the potential of our method.

Since multiplying floating point\nnumbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition\noperations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can\npotentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor\nmultiplications and 80% energy cost of dot products.

Despite its popularity, individuals often report\nvarious information needs regarding buprenorphine treatment on social media\nplatforms like Reddit.

In this study, we propose a theme-based framework to curate and analyze\nlarge-scale data from social media to characterize self-reported treatment\ninformation needs (TINs).\n  Methods: We collected 15,253 posts from r/Suboxone, one of the largest Reddit\nsub-community for buprenorphine products. Following the standard protocol, we\nfirst identified and defined five main themes from the data and then coded\n6,000 posts based on these themes, where one post can be labeled with\napplicable one to three themes. Finally, we determined the most frequently\nappearing sub-themes (topics) for each theme by analyzing samples from each\ngroup.\n  Results: Among the 6,000 posts, 40.3% contained a single theme, 36% two\nthemes, and 13.9% three themes. The most frequent topics for each theme or\ntheme combination came with several key findings - prevalent reporting of\npsychological and physical effects during recovery, complexities in accessing\nbuprenorphine, and significant information gaps regarding medication\nadministration, tapering, and usage of substances during different stages of\nrecovery. Moreover, self-treatment strategies and peer-driven advice reveal\nvaluable insights and potential misconceptions.\n  Conclusions: The findings obtained using our proposed framework can inform\nbetter patient education and patient-provider communication, design systematic\ninterventions to address treatment-related misconceptions and rumors, and\nstreamline the generation of hypotheses for future research.\n","authors":["Madhusudan Basak","Omar Sharif","Sarah E.

To address this, we propose Efficient\nQuantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm.\nEfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all\nparameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters\n(E2E-QP).

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well.

This paper explores a\nnew road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural\nimages. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the\nImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By\nreformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between\nimage pre-training and TSF downstream tasks.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nhas emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations.\nInspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the\nfirst time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution\nof Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision,\nresulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor\ndifferentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii)\nExcessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels,\nleading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs\nrepresenting the background, negatively affecting detection.

This\napproach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of\nmotion-related video content. To ensure temporal continuity and smoothness of\nthe attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation\nregularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving\nimportant ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention\nmaps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of\ninterest over time.

While large vision language\nrepresentations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object\nrecognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because\nCLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively\ncapture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness\nand propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute\nrecognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and\nretrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which\nconverts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling\nproblem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this\nreformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute\nrelations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each\nattribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned\nprobability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to\nobjects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood\nby globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative\nretrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in\nthe sentence.

Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and\nFSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or\nsensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel\nimage similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being\nsensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel\nmetric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into\nvectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors\ncontain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the\ndependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships\nwithin the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively\nmodels the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced\ncomparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared\nto other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms\nexisting similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including\nnoise, compression artifacts and blur.

On the other hand, the unavoidable noise training data provided\nby humans would lead to unsatisfactory model predictions even when inputs are\nedge maps themselves, which also needs a solution. In this paper, more precise\nED models are presented with cascaded skipping density blocks (CSDB). Our\nmodels obtain state-of-the-art(SOTA) predictions in several datasets,\nespecially in average precision rate (AP), over a high-standard benchmark,\nwhich is confirmed by extensive experiments. Also, a novel modification on data\naugmentation for training is employed, which allows noiseless data to be\nemployed in model training for the first time, and thus further improves the\nmodel performance.

However, in transurethral suburethral urological surgical\nrobots, they need to work in a liquid environment. This causes vaporization of\nthe liquid when shearing and heating is performed, resulting in bubble\natomization that affects the visual perception of the robot. This can lead to\nthe need for uninterrupted pauses in the surgical procedure, which makes the\nsurgery take longer. To address the atomization characteristics of liquids\nunder urological surgical robotic vision, we propose an unsupervised zero-shot\ndehaze method (RSF-Dehaze) for urological surgical robotic vision.\nSpecifically, the proposed Region Similarity Filling Module (RSFM) of\nRSF-Dehaze significantly improves the recovery of blurred region tissues. In\naddition, we organize and propose a dehaze dataset for robotic vision in\nurological surgery (USRobot-Dehaze dataset).

We first conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of why pretrained LMMs struggle to understand lengthy video content,\nidentifying that discrepancies between visual and language modalities lead to\ndifferent context windows for visual and language tokens, making it difficult\nto directly extend the visual tokens to match the language context window.\nBased on this, we propose to adapt LMMs for long video understanding tasks by\nextending the visual context window, eliminating the need for retraining on\nlarge scalelong video datasets. To further mitigate the significant memory\nconsumption caused by long sequences, we introduce a progressive pooling\ninference strategy that selectively adjusts the spatial resolution of frame\nembeddings, reducing the number of visual tokens while retaining important\nspatial information.

For this\npurpose, our prototype camera uses a coded aperture with 1k rectangular shape\npinholes in a thin metal plate, such as copper, which hinder the growth of\nbiofouling and keep the surface clean. Although images taken by lens-less\ncameras are usually not well formed due to lack of the traditional glass-based\nlens, a deep learning approach using ViT (Vision Transformer) has recently\ndemonstrated reconstructing original photo images well and our study shows that\nusing gated MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) also yields good results.

While\nprevious methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by\nproducing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its\nsingle-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving\neffectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed\nand improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding\n(MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each\niteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance.\nHowever, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint\ndistribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce\nmulti-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate\nMTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint\ndistribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not\nonly ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding\nefficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error.\nEmpirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B\nparameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2%\nand improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling.\nFurthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than\nconventional speculative decoding methods.

Such policy inevitably trades off between exploitation and exploration.\nCurrently, the prevailing approach is to use various acquisition functions in\nthe Bayesian optimization framework. We discuss whether it is beneficial to\ntrade off exploitation versus exploration by measuring the element and degree\nof surprise associated with the immediate past observation. We devise a\nsurprise-reacting policy using two existing surprise metrics, known as the\nShannon surprise and Bayesian surprise.

While\ntheir applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts\nare under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become\nmore agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency\nof this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning\nthem to human values is vital.\n  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data\n(e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially\ndeduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work,\ninstead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward\nfunctions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement\nLearning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use\nintrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.\n  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of\nDeontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents\nin terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD)\nenvironment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an\nagent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that\ncertain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other\nmatrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with\nintrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to\nhuman values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective\nalternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.\n","authors":["Elizaveta Tennant","Stephen Hailes","Mirco Musolesi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01639v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v1","updated":"2024-10-02T15:07:13Z","published":"2024-10-02T15:07:13Z","title":"Does Graph Prompt Work?

Previous methods either rely on\ndecomposing weight matrices (e.g., LoRA), or seek to decompose gradient\nmatrices (e.g., GaLore) to ensure reduced memory consumption. However, both of\nthem constrain the training in a low-rank subspace, thus inevitably leading to\nsub-optimal performance. This raises a question: whether it is possible to\nconsistently preserve the low-rank constraint for memory efficiency, while\nachieving full-rank training (i.e., training with full-rank gradients of\nfull-rank weights) to avoid inferior outcomes? In this paper, we propose a new\nplug-and-play training framework for LLMs called Fira, as the first attempt to\nachieve this goal. First, we observe an interesting phenomenon during LLM\ntraining: the scaling impact of adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) on the\ngradient norm remains similar from low-rank to full-rank training. Based on\nthis observation, we propose a norm-based scaling method, which utilizes the\nscaling impact of low-rank optimizers as substitutes for that of original\nfull-rank optimizers to enable full-rank training. In this way, we can preserve\nthe low-rank constraint in the optimizer while achieving full-rank training for\nbetter performance. Moreover, we find that there are sudden gradient rises\nduring the optimization process, potentially causing loss spikes. To address\nthis, we further put forward a norm-growth limiter to smooth the gradient via\nregulating the relative increase of gradient norms.

A parallel line\nof work, certified training, has focused on producing networks amenable to\nformal guarantees of robustness against any possible attack.

However, existing models often require specialized designs\ntailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their\ngeneralizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on\ndomain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data\nsplits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across\nunseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \\textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel\nframework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time\nseries imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data\nacross any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series\npatch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and\nits statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the\nimputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation\nmodel. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling\nefficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To\nevaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new\nbenchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable\ndimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples\nfrom diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art\ndomain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking\nprotocol.

In contrast\nto traditional kernel SGD, T-kernel SGD is more effective in balancing bias and\nvariance by dynamically adjusting the hypothesis space during iterations. The\nmost significant advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can achieve\ntheoretically optimal convergence rates using a constant step size (independent\nof the sample size) while overcoming the inherent saturation problem of kernel\nSGD.

Indeed, a wide number of DLWP architectures --\nbased on various backbones, including U-Net, Transformer, Graph Neural Network\n(GNN), and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) -- have demonstrated their potential\nat forecasting atmospheric states. However, due to differences in training\nprotocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if\nany) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather\nforecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a\ndetailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and\ncontrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We\naccomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible\nNavier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. In terms of accuracy,\nmemory consumption, and runtime, our results illustrate various tradeoffs.

Alternatively, invisible image watermarking\nis being researched as a proactive defense technique that allows media\nauthentication by verifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image\npixels. A handful of invisible image watermarking techniques introduced for\nmedia authentication have proven vulnerable to basic image processing\noperations and watermark removal attacks.

Thorough\nexperimental investigations on SOTA facial Deepfake datasets demonstrate that\nour proposed model can embed a $64$-bit secret as an imperceptible image\nwatermark that can be recovered with a high-bit recovery accuracy when benign\nimage processing operations are applied while being non-recoverable when unseen\nDeepfake manipulations are applied.

User Field of View (FoV) is more dynamic with\n6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive streaming\npredicts a user's FoV and only downloads point cloud data falling in the\npredicted FoV. However, it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which can be\nsignificant when a long buffer is utilized for smoothed streaming. In this\nwork, we propose a multi-round progressive refinement framework for point cloud\nvideo streaming. Instead of sequentially downloading point cloud frames, our\nsolution simultaneously downloads/patches multiple frames falling into a\nsliding time-window, leveraging the inherent scalability of octree-based\npoint-cloud coding. The optimal rate allocation among all tiles of active\nframes are solved analytically using the heterogeneous tile rate-quality\nfunctions calibrated by the predicted user FoV.

With only a handful of\nexisting large-scale, domain-specific datasets, creation of new datasets is\nrequired in most applications. This requires the development of new\napplication-specific filtering of web-scale data. Filtering with a\nhigh-performance, general-purpose LLM such as GPT-4o can be highly effective,\nbut this is extremely expensive at web-scale. This paper proposes SIEVE, a\nlightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at a fraction of the cost.\nSIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o\nfiltering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and\nlightweight T5 models, using active learning to fine-tune T5 in the background\nwith a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as\nGPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost.

In\ncontrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in\na single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit\ndata. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce,\nhigh-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a\nsynthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors\nexisting code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally\nsample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write\nprograms. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive\nprogram diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction\n+ program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we\ninstruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B\nparameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset,\ncomparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.

The\nclassification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually\nexploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as\na reference. In the LML process, a dataset is summarized and evaluated to\ndetermine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most.\nIn the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary and a row of the\ntesting dataset to automatically generate a query, which is used to retrieve\nrelevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using\ndata summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with\ncomplex data using context-aware decision-making.

In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM\nframework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store\nfactual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in\nthe KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of\nLLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with\nautomatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG\n(containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured\ninformation) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that\nattribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need\nfor fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks.\nWe pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is\ndesigned to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework\non a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly\ndetection.\n","authors":["Ryan C.

It remains unclear whether they translate\nto the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further\ncomplicates model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind\ncurrent practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals\ndue to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics,\nand incompatibility with base models. In this work, we present HELMET (How to\nEvaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive\nbenchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories.

Consequently, we demonstrate\nthat HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.\nThrough a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks\nlike NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse\ncategories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each\nother; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models\nsignificantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context\nreasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased\nlengths.

Doing so results in a language\nmodel over token strings rather than one over character strings. Vexingly,\nregions of interest are generally misaligned with these token strings. The\npaper argues that token-level language models should be (approximately)\nmarginalized into character-level language models before they are used in\npsycholinguistic studies to compute the surprisal of a region of interest;\nthen, the marginalized character-level language model can be used to compute\nthe surprisal of an arbitrary character substring, which we term a focal area,\nthat the experimenter may wish to use as a predictor.

Two main approaches for\nlearning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in\nRLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through\nmethods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that\nthe implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in\nthe limit.

Ideally,\nLLMs should provide informative responses while avoiding the disclosure of\nharmful or sensitive information. However, current alignment approaches, which\nrely heavily on refusal strategies, such as training models to completely\nreject harmful prompts or applying coarse filters are limited by their binary\nnature. These methods either fully deny access to information or grant it\nwithout sufficient nuance, leading to overly cautious responses or failures to\ndetect subtle harmful content. For example, LLMs may refuse to provide basic,\npublic information about medication due to misuse concerns. Moreover, these\nrefusal-based methods struggle to handle mixed-content scenarios and lack the\nability to adapt to context-dependent sensitivities, which can result in\nover-censorship of benign content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nHiddenGuard, a novel framework for fine-grained, safe generation in LLMs.\nHiddenGuard incorporates Prism (rePresentation Router for In-Stream\nModeration), which operates alongside the LLM to enable real-time, token-level\ndetection and redaction of harmful content by leveraging intermediate hidden\nstates.

Effective benchmarks need to be robust, diverse, and\nchallenging.

Questions - each verified by five independent annotators -\nspan 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquettes. We\nevaluate models on two setups: CulturalBench-Easy and CulturalBench-Hard which\nshare the same questions but asked differently. We find that LLMs are sensitive\nto such difference in setups (e.g., GPT-4o with 27.3% difference). Compared to\nhuman performance (92.6% accuracy), CulturalBench-Hard is more challenging for\nfrontier LLMs with the best performing model (GPT-4o) at only 61.5% and the\nworst (Llama3-8b) at 21.4%. Moreover, we find that LLMs often struggle with\ntricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the\nChinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to converge to a single answer.

However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve\nusers' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents\naccidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains\nlargely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by\nconducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in\nadversarial environments.

We also developed a legal domain specialized BPE tokenizer. We\nevaluated our model using perplexity and zero-shot tasks: case judgment\nprediction with explanation and abstractive case summarization. Paramanu-Ayn\noutperformed Llama-2 7B and Gemini-Pro in case judgment prediction with\nexplanation task on test accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points, despite being\n72 times smaller. In zero-shot abstractive summarization, it surpassed\ndecoder-only LLMs generating fixed-length summaries (5000 tokens) by over 10\npercentage points in BLEU and METEOR metrics, and by nearly 4 percentage points\nin BERTScore. Further evaluations on zero-shot commonsense and mathematical\nbenchmarks showed that Paramanu-Ayn excelled despite being trained exclusively\non legal documents, outperforming Llama-1, Llama-2, and Falcon on\nAGIEVAL-AQuA-RAT and AGIEVAL-SAT-Math tasks. We also instruction-tuned our\nmodel on 10,763 diverse legal tasks, including legal clause generation, legal\ndrafting, case summarization, etc. The Paramanu-Ayn-instruct model scored above\n8 out of 10 in clarity, relevance, completeness, and legal reasoning metrics by\nGPT-3.5-Turbo. We found that our models, were able to learn drafting knowledge\nand generalize to draft legal contracts and legal clauses with limited\ninstruction-tuning. Hence, we conclude that for a strong domain-specialized\ngenerative language model (such as legal), domain specialized pretraining from\nscratch is more cost effective, environmentally friendly, and remains\ncompetitive with larger models or even better than adapting LLMs for legal\ndomain tasks.\n","authors":["Mitodru Niyogi","Arnab Bhattacharya"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13681v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05197v2","updated":"2024-10-03T15:55:40Z","published":"2024-09-08T19:22:58Z","title":"Seemingly Plausible Distractors in Multi-Hop Reasoning: Are Large\n  Language Models Attentive Readers?","summary":"  State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are accredited with an\nincreasing number of different capabilities, ranging from reading\ncomprehension, over advanced mathematical and reasoning skills to possessing\nscientific knowledge.

To understand why they perform so well and to assess their\nreliability, several studies have focused on questions such as: Which\nlinguistic properties are encoded by these models, and to what extent? How\nrobust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with\nperturbations in the input text? However, these studies have mainly focused on\nBERT and the English language. In this paper, we investigate similar questions\nregarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across\n13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual\nTransformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific). To conduct this study,\nwe introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing\napproximately $\\sim$47K sentences. Surprisingly, our probing analysis of\nsurface, syntactic, and semantic properties reveals that while almost all\nmultilingual models demonstrate consistent encoding performance for English,\nthey show mixed results for Indic languages. As expected, Indic-specific\nmultilingual models capture linguistic properties in Indic languages better\nthan universal models. Intriguingly, universal models broadly exhibit better\nrobustness compared to Indic-specific models, particularly under perturbations\nsuch as dropping both nouns and verbs, dropping only verbs, or keeping only\nnouns. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into probing and\nperturbation-specific strengths and weaknesses of popular multilingual\nTransformer-based models for different Indic languages.

When coupled with\ncustom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only\nquantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory\nmovement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized\nLLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are\ncompressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform,\nlookup table (LUT) quantization. This paper describes FLUTE, a flexible lookup\ntable engine for LUT-quantized LLMs, which uses offline restructuring of the\nquantized weight matrix to minimize bit manipulations associated with\nunpacking, and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate\nshared memory bandwidth constraints. At batch sizes < 32 and quantization group\nsize of 128 (typical in LLM inference), the FLUTE kernel can be 2-4x faster\nthan existing GEMM kernels.

Empowering large language models (LLMs) to reason over\ntabular data represents an actively explored direction. However, since typical\nLLMs only support one-dimensional~(1D) inputs, existing methods often flatten\nthe two-dimensional~(2D) table structure into a sequence of tokens, which can\nseverely disrupt the spatial relationships and result in an inevitable loss of\nvital contextual information. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate\nthe detrimental impact of such flattening operations on the performance of LLMs\nin capturing the spatial information of tables through two elaborate proxy\ntasks. Subsequently, we introduce a simple yet effective positional encoding\nmethod, termed ``2D-TPE'' (Two-Dimensional Table Positional Encoding), to\naddress this challenge. 2D-TPE enables each attention head to dynamically\nselect a permutation order of tokens within the context for attending to them,\nwhere each permutation represents a distinct traversal mode for the table, such\nas column-wise or row-wise traversal. 2D-TPE effectively mitigates the risk of\nlosing essential spatial information while preserving computational efficiency,\nthus better preserving the table structure.

DGA is the first gradient alignment\napproach that incurs minimal overhead compared to standard pre-training and\noutputs a competitive model, eliminating the need for retraining the model.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate significant improvements over importance\nsampling in two key scenarios: (i) when the pre-training set is small and\nimportance sampling overfits due to limited data; and (ii) when there is\ninsufficient specialized data, trapping importance sampling on narrow pockets\nof data. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of gradient alignment\nmethods in optimizing training data mixtures, particularly in data-constrained\nenvironments, and offer a practical solution for enhancing LLM performance on\nspecific tasks with limited data availability.\n","authors":["Simin Fan","David Grangier","Pierre Ablin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02498v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02492v1","updated":"2024-10-03T13:57:07Z","published":"2024-10-03T13:57:07Z","title":"DTVLT: A Multi-modal Diverse Text Benchmark for Visual Language Tracking\n  Based on LLM","summary":"  Visual language tracking (VLT) has emerged as a cutting-edge research area,\nharnessing linguistic data to enhance algorithms with multi-modal inputs and\nbroadening the scope of traditional single object tracking (SOT) to encompass\nvideo understanding applications. Despite this, most VLT benchmarks still\ndepend on succinct, human-annotated text descriptions for each video. These\ndescriptions often fall short in capturing the nuances of video content\ndynamics and lack stylistic variety in language, constrained by their uniform\nlevel of detail and a fixed annotation frequency. As a result, algorithms tend\nto default to a \"memorize the answer\" strategy, diverging from the core\nobjective of achieving a deeper understanding of video content. Fortunately,\nthe emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of\ndiverse text. This work utilizes LLMs to generate varied semantic annotations\n(in terms of text lengths and granularities) for representative SOT benchmarks,\nthereby establishing a novel multi-modal benchmark. Specifically, we (1)\npropose a new visual language tracking benchmark with diverse texts, named\nDTVLT, based on five prominent VLT and SOT benchmarks, including three\nsub-tasks: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance\ntracking. (2) We offer four granularity texts in our benchmark, considering the\nextent and density of semantic information. We expect this multi-granular\ngeneration strategy to foster a favorable environment for VLT and video\nunderstanding research.

Existing\nworks propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from\nexternal knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue.

To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs\nwith graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called\nGRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge\nfrom 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called\nGraph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging\nLLMs to reason on the graph iteratively.

Evaluating perceptual distance models using this\ndata reduces the judgements on a triplet to a binary decision, namely, whether\nthe distance model agrees with the human decision - which is suboptimal and\nprone to misleading conclusions. Instead, we statistically model the underlying\ndecision-making process during 2AFC experiments using a binomial distribution.\nHaving enough empirical data, we estimate a smooth and consistent distribution\nof the judgements on the reference-distorted distance plane, according to each\ndistance model. By applying maximum likelihood, we estimate the parameter of\nthe local binomial distribution, and a global measurement of the expected\nlog-likelihood of the measured responses. We calculate meaningful and\nwell-founded metrics for the distance model, beyond the mere prediction\naccuracy as percentage agreement, even with variable numbers of judgements per\ntriplet -- key advantages over both classical and neural network methods.\n","authors":["Alexander Hepburn","Raul Santos-Rodriguez","Javier Portilla"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10390v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02671v1","updated":"2024-10-03T16:54:35Z","published":"2024-10-03T16:54:35Z","title":"Unsupervised Point Cloud Completion through Unbalanced Optimal Transport","summary":"  Unpaired point cloud completion explores methods for learning a completion\nmap from unpaired incomplete and complete point cloud data.

We investigate a new scenario to\nconstruct 3D object detectors: learning from the predictions of a nearby unit\nthat is equipped with an accurate detector. For example, when a self-driving\ncar enters a new area, it may learn from other traffic participants whose\ndetectors have been optimized for that area. This setting is label-efficient,\nsensor-agnostic, and communication-efficient: nearby units only need to share\nthe predictions with the ego agent (e.g., car).

However, challenges arise due to dynamic disturbances, e.g.,\nlight reflections and refraction from the random air-water interface, irregular\nliquid flow, and similar factors, which can lead to potential failures in\nperception and navigation systems. Traditional computer vision algorithms\nstruggle to differentiate between real and virtual image regions, significantly\ncomplicating tasks. A virtual image region is an apparent representation formed\nby the redirection of light rays, typically through reflection or refraction,\ncreating the illusion of an object's presence without its actual physical\nlocation.

However, direct\nself-supervised stereo matching paradigms based on photometric loss functions\nhave consistently struggled with performance issues due to the occlusion\nchallenge. The crux of the occlusion challenge lies in the fact that the\npositions of occluded pixels consistently align with the epipolar search\ndirection defined by the input stereo images, leading to persistent information\nloss and erroneous feedback at fixed locations during self-supervised training.\nIn this work, we propose a simple yet highly effective pseudo-stereo inputs\nstrategy to address the core occlusion challenge. This strategy decouples the\ninput and feedback images, compelling the network to probabilistically sample\ninformation from both sides of the occluding objects. As a result, the\npersistent lack of information in the aforementioned fixed occlusion areas is\nmitigated. Building upon this, we further address feedback conflicts and\noverfitting issues arising from the strategy.

Tumor cells at low concentrations remain undetectable, for\nexample, in the most frequent type of primary brain tumors, glioblastoma.\nDeep-learning-based approaches fail to estimate the complete tumor cell\ndistribution due to a lack of reliable training data.

We expect this multi-granular\ngeneration strategy to foster a favorable environment for VLT and video\nunderstanding research. (3) We conduct comprehensive experimental analyses on\nDTVLT, evaluating the impact of diverse text on tracking performance and hope\nthe identified performance bottlenecks of existing algorithms can support\nfurther research in VLT and video understanding.

Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data,\nimproving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this\npaper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging\nstep by step.

Typically,\nsamples can be modeled as a sample graph, where nodes are samples and edges\nrepresent their similarities. Most existing methods are based on local\ninformation, such as the training difficulty of samples, thereby overlooking\nglobal information, such as connectivity patterns. This oversight can result in\nsuboptimal selection because global information is crucial for ensuring that\nthe selected samples well represent the structural properties of the graph. To\naddress this issue, we employ structural entropy to quantify global information\nand losslessly decompose it from the whole graph to individual nodes using the\nShapley value. Based on the decomposition, we present\n$\\textbf{S}$tructural-$\\textbf{E}$ntropy-based sample $\\textbf{S}$election\n($\\textbf{SES}$), a method that integrates both global and local information to\nselect informative and representative samples. SES begins by constructing a\n$k$NN-graph among samples based on their similarities. It then measures sample\nimportance by combining structural entropy (global metric) with training\ndifficulty (local metric).

Recent advancements in deep learning have made automatic road extraction\nfrom historical maps feasible, yet these methods typically require large\namounts of labeled training data. To address this challenge, we introduce a\nnovel framework that integrates deep learning with geoinformation,\ncomputer-based painting, and image processing methodologies. This framework\nenables the extraction and classification of roads from historical maps using\nonly road geometries without needing road class labels for training. The\nprocess begins with training of a binary segmentation model to extract road\ngeometries, followed by morphological operations, skeletonization,\nvectorization, and filtering algorithms. Synthetic training data is then\ngenerated by a painting function that artificially re-paints road segments\nusing predefined symbology for road classes. Using this synthetic data, a deep\nensemble is trained to generate pixel-wise probabilities for road classes to\nmitigate distribution shift. These predictions are then discretized along the\nextracted road geometries.

In\ncontrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in\na single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit\ndata. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce,\nhigh-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a\nsynthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors\nexisting code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally\nsample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write\nprograms. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive\nprogram diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction\n+ program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we\ninstruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B\nparameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset,\ncomparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.

This paper\nintroduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nclassification tasks in an explainable way. Unlike ML models that rely heavily\non data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process\nusing LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called \"Language Model Learning\n(LML)\" powered by a new method called \"Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)\". The\nclassification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually\nexploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as\na reference. In the LML process, a dataset is summarized and evaluated to\ndetermine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most.\nIn the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary and a row of the\ntesting dataset to automatically generate a query, which is used to retrieve\nrelevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using\ndata summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with\ncomplex data using context-aware decision-making. LML and DAP unlock the\npossibilities of new applications. The proposed method uses the words \"Act as\nan Explainable Machine Learning Model\" in the prompt to enhance the\ninterpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic\nbehind each prediction.

Two main approaches for\nlearning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in\nRLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through\nmethods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

However, the choice of\nregression loss, which can highly influence the exploration and exploitation\nbehavior of the under-training policy, has been overlooked. Due to the lack of\ntheoretical understanding for choosing an appropriate regression loss, most\nexisting algorithms train the flow network by minimizing the squared error of\nthe forward and backward flows in log-space, i.e., using the quadratic\nregression loss. In this work, we rigorously prove that distinct regression\nlosses correspond to specific divergence measures, enabling us to design and\nanalyze regression losses according to the desired properties of the\ncorresponding divergence measures.

In recent months, more than 10 new methods\nhave been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs.\nContrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed -- but randomized -- records\nor models, these methods are mostly evaluated on datasets collected post-hoc.\nSets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed\nusing informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization\nraises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In the\nfirst part, we review the literature on MIAs against LLMs. While most work\nfocuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, we show that a\nrange of target models, motivations and units of interest have been considered\nin the literature. We then quantify distribution shifts present in the 6\ndatasets used in the literature, ranging from books to papers, using a bag of\nword classifier. Our analysis reveals that all of them suffer from severe\ndistribution shifts. This challenges the validity of using such setups to\nmeasure LLM memorization and may undermine the benchmarking of recently\nproposed methods. Yet, all hope might not be lost. In the second part, we\nintroduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and\ndiscuss potential ways forward: randomized test splits, injections of\nrandomized (unique) sequences, randomized finetuning, and post-hoc control\nmethods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we\nbelieve they collectively provide solid grounds to guide the development of MIA\nmethods and study LLM memorization.

In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for\nGUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly take\npixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can\naccurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their\ncoordinates on the GUI across different platforms.

Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three\ncategories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround\nsubstantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by\nup to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art\nagents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input\nwhile ours only uses visual perception.

In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a\nconstant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in\nprinciple continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then,\ngiven any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper\nat any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model.\nEmpirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains\nelevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase.\nTowards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss\nexhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river\nat its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the\niterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it\nprogresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly\ndropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer\nto the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained\nhigh learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress\nin the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical.\nOur analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and\nshows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram\ndataset.

This leads to more\nstringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM\nmust be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To\nalleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the\ndraft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to\nreduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named\nAtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K\nalignment under the strict top-K verification.

However, SAEs are\nusually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to\nuse them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem,\nwe introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual\nstream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual\nstream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE\nlatents to `switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers.\nInterestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single\nlayer for a given token or prompt, but this layer may differ for different\ntokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over\nlayers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the\ndistributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of\nmagnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token.\nFor larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at\nmultiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual\nstream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar.

SH2 is based on a simple fact rooted in\ninformation theory that for an LLM, the tokens predicted with lower\nprobabilities are prone to be more informative than others. Our analysis shows\nthat the tokens assigned with lower probabilities by an LLM are more likely to\nbe closely related to factual information, such as nouns, proper nouns, and\nadjectives. Therefore, we propose to ''highlight'' the factual information by\nselecting the tokens with the lowest probabilities and concatenating them to\nthe original context, thus forcing the model to repeatedly read and hesitate on\nthese tokens before generation. During decoding, we also adopt contrastive\ndecoding to emphasize the difference in the output probabilities brought by the\nhesitation. Experimental results demonstrate that our SH2, requiring no\nadditional data or models, can effectively help LLMs elicit factual knowledge\nand distinguish hallucinated contexts.

Utilizing symbolic graphics\nprograms, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic\nreasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs\nprocedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in\ngeneral program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new\nlayer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer\ndifferent-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries\nwithout a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs,\nLLMs would need to possess the ability to \"imagine\" and reason how the\ncorresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description.\nWe use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the\nsemantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally\nwith minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of\nimages that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing\nsignificant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and\nopen-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about\nvisual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning\ngenerally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this\nability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned\nwith pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs.\nInterestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on\nsymbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various\nother benchmarks.\n","authors":["Zeju Qiu","Weiyang Liu","Haiwen Feng","Zhen Liu","Tim Z.

Existing defenses, such as prompt engineering and safety\nfine-tuning, often introduce computational overhead, increase inference\nlatency, and lack runtime flexibility. Moreover, overly restrictive safety\nmeasures can degrade model utility by causing refusals of benign queries. In\nthis paper, we introduce Jailbreak Antidote, a method that enables real-time\nadjustment of LLM safety preferences by manipulating a sparse subset of the\nmodel's internal states during inference.

Traditional TSE approaches predominantly rely\non voiceprints, which raise privacy concerns and face issues related to the\nquality and availability of enrollment samples, as well as intra-speaker\nvariability. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel text-guided\nTSE paradigm named LLM-TSE. In this paradigm, a state-of-the-art large language\nmodel, LLaMA 2, processes typed text input from users to extract semantic cues.\nWe demonstrate that textual descriptions alone can effectively serve as cues\nfor extraction, thus addressing privacy concerns and reducing dependency on\nvoiceprints.

Existing methods\ntypically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence.\nHowever, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods,\ncarrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond\nto streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time\nsetting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial\nconstraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional\nchallenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text\ndescriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene\ngeometry. To address these limitations, we propose DART, a Diffusion-based\nAutoregressive motion primitive model for Real-time Text-driven motion control.\nOur model, DART, effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly\nconditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models.

In light of this, this paper investigates a lightweight Interval\nGroup Spatial-Spectral Mamba framework (IGroupSS-Mamba) for HSI classification,\nwhich allows for multi-directional and multi-scale global spatial-spectral\ninformation extraction in a grouping and hierarchical manner. Technically, an\nInterval Group S6 Mechanism (IGSM) is developed as the core component, which\npartitions high-dimensional features into multiple non-overlapping groups at\nintervals, and then integrates a unidirectional S6 for each group with a\nspecific scanning direction to achieve non-redundant sequence modeling.\nCompared to conventional applying multi-directional scanning to all bands, this\ngrouping strategy leverages the complementary strengths of different scanning\ndirections while decreasing computational costs.

A\nkey insight of this work is to leverage the {duality} between photorealistic\nreconstructions, which render realistic 2D images from 3D structure, and\n\\emph{3D foundation models}, which predict 3D structure from image pairs. To\nthis end, we develop PhotoReg, a framework to register multiple photorealistic\n\\ac{3DGS} models with 3D foundation models. As \\ac{3DGS} models are generally\nbuilt from monocular camera images, they have \\emph{arbitrary scale}. To\nresolve this, PhotoReg actively enforces scale consistency among the different\n\\ac{3DGS} models by considering depth estimates within these models. Then, the\nalignment is iteratively refined with fine-grained photometric losses to\nproduce high-quality fused \\ac{3DGS} models. We rigorously evaluate PhotoReg on\nboth standard benchmark datasets and our custom-collected datasets, including\nwith two quadruped robots.

Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and\ncopyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks\nprofound exploration targeted at 3DGS.

This architecture adds the 2D scattering transform and\nattention mechanisms to YOLOv8, achieving an mAP of 75.46% and an 25.3 ms per\nframe, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by over 5%. To improve small and\ndistant ship recognition in high-resolution images on embedded systems, an\nenhanced slicing mechanism is introduced, improving mAP by 8% to 11%.\nAdditionally, a georeferencing method is proposed, achieving positioning errors\nof 18 m for ships up to 400 m away and 44 m for ships between 400 m and 1200 m.\nThe findings are also applied in real-world scenarios, such as the detection of\nabnormal ship behaviour, camera integrity assessment and 3D reconstruction. The\napproach of this thesis outperforms existing methods and provides a framework\nfor integrating recognized and georeferenced ships into real-time systems,\nenhancing operational effectiveness and decision-making for maritime\nstakeholders. This thesis contributes to the maritime computer vision field by\nestablishing a benchmark for ship segmentation and georeferencing research,\ndemonstrating the viability of deep-learning-based recognition and\ngeoreferencing methods for real-time maritime monitoring.\n","authors":["Borja Carrillo Perez"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04946v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04940v1","updated":"2024-10-07T11:32:17Z","published":"2024-10-07T11:32:17Z","title":"Next state prediction gives rise to entangled, yet compositional\n  representations of objects","summary":"  Compositional representations are thought to enable humans to generalize\nacross combinatorially vast state spaces.

We investigate the influence of bias\non interval lengths of two different types of adjustments -- symmetric\nadjustments, the conventional method where both sides of the interval are\nadjusted equally, and asymmetric adjustments, a more flexible method where the\ninterval can be adjusted unequally in positive or negative directions. We\npresent theoretical and empirical analyses characterizing how symmetric and\nasymmetric adjustments impact the \"tightness\" of CP intervals for regression\ntasks. Specifically for absolute residual and quantile-based non-conformity\nscores, we prove: 1) the upper bound of symmetrically adjusted interval lengths\nincreases by $2|b|$ where $b$ is a globally applied scalar value representing\nbias, 2) asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are not affected by bias, and\n3) conditions when asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are guaranteed to\nbe smaller than symmetric ones. Our analyses suggest that even if predictions\nexhibit significant drift from ground truth values, asymmetrically adjusted\nintervals are still able to maintain the same tightness and validity of\nintervals as if the drift had never happened, while symmetric ones\nsignificantly inflate the lengths.

To address the limitations of both on- and off-policy RLHF,\nwe propose a preference optimization method that aligns DMs with preferences\nwithout relying on reward models or paired human-annotated data. Specifically,\nwe introduce a Semi-Policy Preference Optimization (SePPO) method. SePPO\nleverages previous checkpoints as reference models while using them to generate\non-policy reference samples, which replace \"losing images\" in preference pairs.\nThis approach allows us to optimize using only off-policy \"winning images.\"\nFurthermore, we design a strategy for reference model selection that expands\nthe exploration in the policy space. Notably, we do not simply treat reference\nsamples as negative examples for learning. Instead, we design an anchor-based\ncriterion to assess whether the reference samples are likely to be winning or\nlosing images, allowing the model to selectively learn from the generated\nreference samples. This approach mitigates performance degradation caused by\nthe uncertainty in reference sample quality. We validate SePPO across both\ntext-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks.

Previous\nwork aiming to improve instruction-tuning performance often emphasizes the need\nfor higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, which typically\ninvolves expensive data filtering with proprietary LLMs or labor-intensive data\ngeneration by human annotators. However, these approaches do not fully leverage\nthe datasets' intrinsic properties, resulting in high computational and labor\ncosts, thereby limiting scalability and performance gains. In this paper, we\npropose SFTMix, a novel recipe that elevates instruction-tuning performance\nbeyond the conventional NTP paradigm, without the need for well-curated\ndatasets. Observing that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic\nrepresentation space, we argue that examples with different confidence levels\nshould play distinct roles during the instruction-tuning process. Based on this\ninsight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying\nconfidence levels, then applies a Mixup-based regularization to mitigate\noverfitting on confident examples while propagating supervision signals to\nimprove learning on relatively unconfident ones. This approach enables SFTMix\nto significantly outperform NTP across a wide range of instruction-following\nand healthcare domain-specific SFT tasks, demonstrating its adaptability to\ndiverse LLM families and scalability to datasets of any size.

In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a\nconstant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in\nprinciple continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then,\ngiven any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper\nat any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model.\nEmpirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains\nelevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase.\nTowards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss\nexhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river\nat its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the\niterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it\nprogresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly\ndropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer\nto the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained\nhigh learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress\nin the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical.\nOur analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and\nshows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram\ndataset.

Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system\nprompts. For example, ChatGPT uses \"You are a helpful assistant\" as part of its\ndefault system prompt. Despite current practices of adding personas to system\nprompts, it remains unclear how different personas affect a model's performance\non objective tasks. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of\npersonas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of\ninterpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise. Through extensive\nanalysis of 4 popular families of LLMs and 2,410 factual questions, we\ndemonstrate that adding personas in system prompts does not improve model\nperformance across a range of questions compared to the control setting where\nno persona is added. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that the gender,\ntype, and domain of the persona can all influence the resulting prediction\naccuracies. We further experimented with a list of persona search strategies\nand found that, while aggregating results from the best persona for each\nquestion significantly improves prediction accuracy, automatically identifying\nthe best persona is challenging, with predictions often performing no better\nthan random selection.

Prior work has shown that an ensemble of models is\nmore resilient to transferability: the probability that an adversarial example\nis effective against most models of the ensemble is low. Thus, most ongoing\nresearch focuses on improving ensemble diversity. Another line of prior work\nhas shown that Lipschitz continuity of the models can make models more robust\nsince it limits how a model's output changes with small input perturbations. In\nthis paper, we study the effect of Lipschitz continuity on transferability\nrates. We show that although a lower Lipschitz constant increases the\nrobustness of a single model, it is not as beneficial in training robust\nensembles as it increases the transferability rate of adversarial examples\nacross models in the ensemble. Therefore, we introduce LOTOS, a new training\nparadigm for ensembles, which counteracts this adverse effect. It does so by\npromoting orthogonality among the top-$k$ sub-spaces of the transformations of\nthe corresponding affine layers of any pair of models in the ensemble.

Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a\nfundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing\neither long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory\n(non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by\nretrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability,\ngeneralization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong\nediting settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will\ncause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor\nreliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can\nhardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor\ngeneralization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories.\nIn WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main\nmemory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge.\nWe only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide\nwhich memory to go through when given a query.

Thus, we call for rigorous assessment of\nagents on individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims\non end-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new\nbenchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery.\nTo ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our\nbenchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four\ndisciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify\nthe target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and\nemploy an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs,\nexecution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual\nvalidation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation\nquality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies\nto mitigate data contamination concerns.

These models achieved\nstate-of-the-art correlation scores on important benchmark datasets. However,\nwhat has not been reviewed is whether spatio-temporal relationships are even\nrequired to achieve state-of-the-art results. Previous work in activity\nrecognition has found biases, by prioritizing static cues such as scenes or\nobjects, over motion information. In this paper we inquire if similar spurious\nrelationships might influence the task of video summarization. To do so, we\nanalyse the role that temporal information plays on existing benchmark\ndatasets. We first estimate a baseline with temporally invariant models to see\nhow well such models rank on benchmark datasets (TVSum and SumMe). We then\ndisrupt the temporal order of the videos to investigate the impact it has on\nexisting state-of-the-art models. One of our findings is that the temporally\ninvariant models achieve competitive correlation scores that are close to the\nhuman baselines on the TVSum dataset. We also demonstrate that existing models\nare not affected by temporal perturbations. Furthermore, with certain\ndisruption strategies that shuffle fixed time segments, we can actually improve\ntheir correlation scores.

Recent developments allow for\ntext-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal\neffort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example,\ndiffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into\nthe original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case,\ntraditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper\nintroduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive\ncollection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image\nforgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF\ndataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular\nopen-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas\ntraditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect\nregenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the\nregenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted\narea. Finally, both IFL and SID methods fail when exposed to stronger\ncompression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such\nas WEBP. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of\nstate-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern\ngenerative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable\nIFL and SID methods.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber, that\nproduces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure.\nSpecifically, we propose a self-supervised model that regresses features on\nsyllabic segments distilled from a teacher model which is an exponential moving\naverage of the model in training. This results in a highly structured\nrepresentation of speech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast,\nlinear-time syllable segmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization\nwith an average of 4.27 tokens per second, and 3) syllabic units better suited\nfor lexical and syntactic understanding. We also train token-to-speech\ngenerative models with our syllabic units and show that fully intelligible\nspeech can be reconstructed from these tokens. Lastly, we observe that\ncategorical perception, a linguistic phenomenon of speech perception, emerges\nnaturally in our model, making the embedding space more categorical and sparse\nthan previous self-supervised learning approaches. Together, we present a novel\nself-supervised approach for representing speech as syllables, with significant\npotential for efficient speech tokenization and spoken language modeling.\n","authors":["Cheol Jun Cho","Nicholas Lee","Akshat Gupta","Dhruv Agarwal","Ethan Chen","Alan W Black","Gopala K.

However, most publicly available RNNs (e.g., Mamba\nand RWKV) are trained on sequences with less than 10K tokens, and their\neffectiveness in longer contexts remains largely unsatisfying so far. In this\npaper, we study the cause of the inability to process long context for RNNs and\nsuggest critical mitigations. We examine two practical concerns when applying\nstate-of-the-art RNNs to long contexts: (1) the inability to extrapolate to\ninputs longer than the training length and (2) the upper bound of memory\ncapacity. Addressing the first concern, we first investigate *state collapse*\n(SC), a phenomenon that causes severe performance degradation on sequence\nlengths not encountered during training. With controlled experiments, we\nattribute this to overfitting due to the recurrent state being\noverparameterized for the training length. For the second concern, we train a\nseries of Mamba-2 models on long documents to empirically estimate the\nrecurrent state capacity in language modeling and passkey retrieval. Then,\nthree SC mitigation methods are proposed to improve Mamba-2's length\ngeneralizability, allowing the model to process more than 1M tokens without SC.\nWe also find that the recurrent state capacity in passkey retrieval scales\nexponentially to the state size, and we empirically train a Mamba-2 370M with\nnear-perfect passkey retrieval accuracy on 256K context length.

At the core of chatbots are the\nNatural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to\ncomprehend and respond to user queries. Before deploying NLUs, there is a need\nto train them with labeled data. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE\nchatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This\nchallenge arises because training SE chatbots requires specialized vocabulary\nand phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, chatbot\ndevelopers often resort to manually annotating user queries to gather the data\nnecessary for training effective chatbots, a process that is both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive. Previous studies propose approaches to\nsupport chatbot practitioners in annotating users' posed queries. However,\nthese approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling\nfunctions (LFs), that identify and categorize user queries based on specific\npatterns in the data. To address this issue, we propose an approach to\nautomatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the queries of\nfour diverse SE datasets (namely AskGit, MSA, Ask Ubuntu, and Stack Overflow)\nand measure the performance improvement gained from training the NLU on the\nqueries labeled by the generated LFs.

Most fundamentally, it is systematic,\nmeaning that signals can be broken down into component parts that are\nindividually meaningful -- roughly, words -- which are combined in a regular\nway to form sentences. Furthermore, the way in which these parts are combined\nmaintains a kind of locality: words are usually concatenated together, and they\nform contiguous phrases, keeping related parts of sentences close to each\nother. We address the challenge of understanding how these basic properties of\nlanguage arise from broader principles of efficient communication under\ninformation processing constraints. Here we show that natural-language-like\nsystematicity arises in codes that are constrained by predictive information, a\nmeasure of the amount of information that must be extracted from the past of a\nsequence in order to predict its future. In simulations, we show that such\ncodes approximately factorize their source distributions, and then express the\nresulting factors systematically and locally. Next, in a series of\ncross-linguistic corpus studies, we show that human languages are structured to\nhave low predictive information at the levels of phonology, morphology, syntax,\nand semantics. Our result suggests that human language performs a sequential,\ndiscrete form of Independent Components Analysis on the statistical\ndistribution over meanings that need to be expressed.

These problems can be effectively addressed by\nemploying a fully unsupervised technique for speech separation. In this paper,\nwe use contrastive learning to establish the representations of frames then use\nthe learned representations in the downstream deep modularization task.\nConcretely, we demonstrate experimentally that in speech separation, different\nframes of a speaker can be viewed as augmentations of a given hidden standard\nframe of that speaker. The frames of a speaker contain enough prosodic\ninformation overlap which is key in speech separation. Based on this, we\nimplement a self-supervised learning to learn to minimize the distance between\nframes belonging to a given speaker. The learned representations are used in a\ndownstream deep modularization task to cluster frames based on speaker\nidentity.

We first\ndefine the ideal distribution - the one closest to the original model, which\nalso always satisfies the expressed constraint - as the ultimate goal of\nguaranteed generation. We then state a fundamental limitation, namely that it\nis impossible to reach that goal through autoregressive training alone. This\nmotivates the necessity of combining training-time and inference-time methods\nto enforce such guarantees. Based on this insight, we propose GUARD, a simple\nyet effective approach that combines an autoregressive proposal distribution\nwith rejection sampling.

By utilizing orthogonal standard basis vectors\nto initialize one of the low-rank matrices (either $\\mathbf{A}$ or\n$\\mathbf{B}$), SBoRA facilitates regional weight updates and memory-efficient\nfine-tuning. This results in two variants, SBoRA-FA and SBoRA-FB, where only\none of the matrices is updated, leading to a sparse update matrix\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta} \\mathbf{W}$ with predominantly zero rows or columns.\nConsequently, most of the fine-tuned model's weights\n$(\\mathbf{W}_0+\\mathrm{\\Delta} \\mathbf{W})$ remain unchanged from the\npre-trained weights, akin to the modular organization of the human brain, which\nefficiently adapts to new tasks.

Although these methods\nleverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they\noverlook the frequently occurring subtle errors. A major reason is that sampled\npreference pairs involve differences unrelated to the errors, which may\ndistract the model from focusing on subtle errors. In this work, we propose a\nnovel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE),\nwhich injects predefined subtle errors into partial tokens of correct solutions\nto construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the model\nitself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed\nsubtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their\ncorresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions\nobtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO\ntraining.

It addresses key limitations by\ngenerating motion-informative text embeddings, significantly enhancing the\nrelevance and semantics of generated motion sequences.

The techniques of machine\nunlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these\nrisks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt\nattacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images\ncontaining concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to\nenhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of\nadversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust\nunlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this\neffectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a\nstraightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs' image generation quality\npost-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization\non an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure\nrobustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text\nencoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet,\nensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a\nplug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform\nextensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn\nacross various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity,\nobjects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also\nachieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility.

Nonetheless, we show that even a \"null model\" that\nalways outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat\nautomatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on\nAlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench.\nMoreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that\nthe instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are\nprivate and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily\nproof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible\ncheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional\nimpact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for\nreliable automatic benchmarks.

Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has attracted\nattention due to its ability to adapt a pre-trained model to a target domain\nwithout re-accessing the source domain. However, existing TTA algorithms are\nprimarily designed for attribute shifts in vision tasks, where samples are\nindependent. These methods perform poorly on graph data that experience\nstructure shifts, where node connectivity differs between source and target\ngraphs. We attribute this performance gap to the distinct impact of node\nattribute shifts versus graph structure shifts: the latter significantly\ndegrades the quality of node representations and blurs the boundaries between\ndifferent node categories. To address structure shifts in graphs, we propose\nAdaRC, an innovative framework designed for effective and efficient adaptation\nto structure shifts by adjusting the hop-aggregation parameters in GNNs. To\nenhance the representation quality, we design a prediction-informed clustering\nloss to encourage the formation of distinct clusters for different node\ncategories.

Furthermore, existing learning-based codecs lack\nscalability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a\ncontent-adaptive diffusion model for scalable image compression. The proposed\nmethod encodes fine textures through a diffusion process, enhancing perceptual\nquality while preserving essential features for machine vision tasks. The\napproach employs a Markov palette diffusion model combined with widely used\nfeature extractors and image generators, enabling efficient data compression.\nBy leveraging collaborative texture-semantic feature extraction and\npseudo-label generation, the method accurately captures texture information. A\ncontent-adaptive Markov palette diffusion model is then applied to represent\nboth low-level textures and high-level semantic content in a scalable manner.\nThis framework offers flexible control over compression ratios by selecting\nintermediate diffusion states, eliminating the need for retraining deep\nlearning models at different operating points. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both image\nreconstruction and downstream machine vision tasks such as object detection,\nsegmentation, and facial landmark detection, achieving superior perceptual\nquality compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n","authors":["Sha Guo","Zhuo Chen","Yang Zhao","Ning Zhang","Xiaotong Li","Lingyu Duan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06149v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06068v1","updated":"2024-10-08T14:14:46Z","published":"2024-10-08T14:14:46Z","title":"Resolution limit of the eye: how many pixels can we see?","summary":"  As large engineering efforts go towards improving the resolution of mobile,\nAR and VR displays, it is important to know the maximum resolution at which\nfurther improvements bring no noticeable benefit. This limit is often referred\nto as the \"retinal resolution\", although the limiting factor may not\nnecessarily be attributed to the retina. To determine the ultimate resolution\nat which an image appears sharp to our eyes with no perceivable blur, we\ncreated an experimental setup with a sliding display, which allows for\ncontinuous control of the resolution. The lack of such control was the main\nlimitation of the previous studies. We measure achromatic (black-white) and\nchromatic (red-green and yellow-violet) resolution limits for foveal vision,\nand at two eccentricities (10 and 20 deg). Our results demonstrate that the\nresolution limit is higher than what was previously believed, reaching 94\npixels-per-degree (ppd) for foveal achromatic vision, 89 ppd for red-green\npatterns, and 53 ppd for yellow-violet patterns. We also observe a much larger\ndrop in the resolution limit for chromatic patterns (red-green and\nyellow-violet) than for achromatic. Our results set the north star for display\ndevelopment, with implications for future imaging, rendering and video coding\ntechnologies.\n","authors":["Maliha Ashraf","Alexandre Chapiro","Rafał K.

The rising global\npopularity of Japanese manga has made the object detection of character faces\nincreasingly important, with potential applications such as automatic\ncolorization. However, obtaining sufficient data for training conventional\nobject detectors is challenging due to copyright restrictions. Additionally,\nnew characters appear every time a new volume of manga is released, making it\nimpractical to re-train object detectors each time to detect these new\ncharacters. Therefore, one-shot object detection, where only a single query\n(reference) image is required to detect a new character, is an essential task\nin the manga industry. One challenge with one-shot object detection in manga is\nthe large variation in the poses and facial expressions of characters in target\nimages, despite having only one query image as a reference. Another challenge\nis that the frequency of character appearances follows a long-tail\ndistribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a data augmentation\nmethod in feature space to increase the variation of the query. The proposed\nmethod augments the feature from the query by adding Gaussian noise, with the\nnoise variance at each channel learned during training. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed method improves the performance for both seen\nand unseen classes, surpassing data augmentation methods in image space.\n","authors":["Takara Taniguchi","Ryosuke Furuta"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05935v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ACM Multimedia Asia 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05767v1","updated":"2024-10-08T07:48:34Z","published":"2024-10-08T07:48:34Z","title":"Grounding is All You Need? Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog","summary":"  In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video\ncontent and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a\nsegment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained\nvisual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves\ndeep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate\nobject trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This\npaper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model\n(DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant\napproaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog\nturn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and\ngrounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of\nDTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing\nand acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures\nmore nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between\nvideo and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive\nlearning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip\npairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are\ncategorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our\nholistic end-to-end response generation mechanism.

Existing OVD methods mainly rely on the powerful open-vocabulary\nimage-text alignment capability of Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLM) such\nas CLIP. However, CLIP is trained on image-text pairs and lacks the perceptual\nability for local regions within an image, resulting in the gap between image\nand region representations. Directly using CLIP for OVD causes inaccurate\nregion classification. We find the image-region gap is primarily caused by the\ndeformation of region feature maps during region of interest (RoI) extraction.\nTo mitigate the inaccurate region classification in OVD, we propose a new\nShape-Invariant Adapter named SIA-OVD to bridge the image-region gap in the OVD\ntask. SIA-OVD learns a set of feature adapters for regions with different\nshapes and designs a new adapter allocation mechanism to select the optimal\nadapter for each region. The adapted region representations can align better\nwith text representations learned by CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SIA-OVD effectively improves the classification accuracy for regions by\naddressing the gap between images and regions caused by shape deformation.\nSIA-OVD achieves substantial improvements over representative methods on the\nCOCO-OVD benchmark.
